# 🔗🚲Analysis of the Bike Sharing Dataset

The primary objective of developing this final project dashboard for bicycle dataset analysis is to fulfill the capstone project requirements in the **Data Analysis learning program** offered by **Dicoding**. 

Additionally, I have built this dashboard using **Streamlit** to provide an **interactive and user-friendly interface** for data visualization and insights. 

To access it, you may navigate to the **Dashboard** section and click on the [Bike Sharing Dataset](https://sharing-dataset-wawa.streamlit.app/) option. This will direct you to the relevant data interface, where you can explore and analyze the dataset in detail.
